# Rover
Rover is a simple INO file which can be used to control a rover. 

Greetings! :)

Rover is a simple project in which a rover can 
be controlled with bluetooth. The project is 
done utilizing an Arduino Uno Rover. Each 
wheel has its own motor which can be controlled
individually utilizing a motor driver. For
bluetooth communications with controller I utilized
a HM10 Bluetooth unit. Once you're project is 
setup to actually control the rover you may utilize 
any type of bluetooth communication medium to pass
the HM10 a string/char. The accepted inputs are 
W, A, S, D, 0 (Keyboard gaming is the way to go ;)). 
If you setup an interface for your controller, you 
may pass the variables upon button click. 

Adios ;)
